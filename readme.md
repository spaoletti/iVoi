# E... Voi simulator
> A 100% perfect simulation of my friends WhatsApp group.

So my buddies are original guys but also not. So I simulate them. So I can make fun of them. 
Because I am the best and also the worst. "E... Voi" is the name of the group.

## Install and run

You need a JVM (8+) and kotlin. Then you can run the gradle wrapper.

## Notes

I actually made a proper OO design for this one. You can find it in the root of the project, in 
all its handwritten glory.
