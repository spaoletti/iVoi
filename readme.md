# E... Voi simulator
> A 100% perfect simulation of your typical WhatsApp group.

So I told my buddies on WhatsApp, guys, you are so repetitive, you always write the same things, you could be
simulated with a simple software, and they were like, ha! Prove it. So, yeah. What can you do about that.

("E... Voi" is the name of the group. It means "And... You". Nobody remembers why we named it like that
ten years ago.)


## Install and run

You need a JVM (8+) and kotlin. Then you can run the gradle wrapper.


## Notes

I actually made a proper OO design for this stupid thing, you can find the pdf in the root of the project, in all its handwritten glory.
